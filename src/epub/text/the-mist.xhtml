			<p>The mist said unto the mist: “Let us go up into the Downs.” And the mist came up weeping.</p>
			<p>And the mist went into the high places and the hollows.</p>
			<p>And clumps of trees in the distance stood ghostly in the haze.</p>
			<p>But I went to a prophet, one who loved the Downs, and I said to him: “Why does the mist come up weeping into the Downs when it goes into the high places and the hollows?”</p>
			<p>And he answered: “The mist is the company of a multitude of souls who never saw the Downs, and now are dead. Therefore they come up weeping into the Downs, who are dead and never saw them.”</p>
