			<h2 epub:type="title">A Mistaken Identity</h2>
			<p>Fame as she walked at evening in a city saw the painted face of Notoriety flaunting beneath a gas-lamp, and many kneeled unto her in the dirt of the road.</p>
			<p>"Who are you?" Fame said to her.</p>
			<p>"I am Fame," said Notoriety.</p>
			<p>Then Fame stole softly away so that no one knew she had gone.</p>
			<p>And Notoriety presently went forth and all her worshippers rose and followed after, and she led them, as was most meet, to her native Pit.</p>
