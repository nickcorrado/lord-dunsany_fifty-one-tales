			<p>Returning late one night from roaming amongst the stars I came on Mother Earth sitting all dark in Space, murmuring tales of her children.</p>
			<p>“Dreams and battles,” she said. “Dreams and battles.” I heard her say nothing more.</p>
			<p>I said to her: “O Mother, your sons have done marvellous things.” I told her of all our machinery, politics, science; the famous inventions of Man.</p>
			<p>Of all these things she had remembered nothing.</p>
			<p>“But Steam!” I said. “And Electricity.”</p>
			<p>No, she remembered nothing, but muttered of poets and heroes. Not even mention of our Parliament moved her.</p>
			<p>“Dreams and battles,” she said. “Dreams and battles,” and fell to muttering poems and crooning of ancient wars.</p>
			<p>Mother, Mother, you shall remember us.</p>
